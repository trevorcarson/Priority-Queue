# Priority-Queue
Implement a Priority Queue using a Max-Heap and an array under the hood
Files:
- PriorityNode: A class for storing data in a Priority Queue.
- MaxPQ: Implement a Priority Queue using a Max-Heap and an array under the hood
This was one of the harder Data Structures I made, as understanding how to remove items from the queue without damaging the rest of the heap was tough.
